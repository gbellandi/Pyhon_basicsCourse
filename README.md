 The material shown in these notebooks is a condesed version of the material gathered in the years from different sources that I consider very useful for a beginner.
 Among the most inspiring sources:
> *https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html
> *https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_getstarted.asp
> *DS Data manipulation, analysis and visualisation in Python December, 2016*
