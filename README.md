# Pyhon_basicsCourse
 First tools to start using python for data analysis and modelling
 
 The material shown in these notebooks is a condesed version of the material gathered in the years from different sources that I consider very useful for a beginner.
 Among the most inspiring sources:
> *DS Data manipulation, analysis and visualisation in Python December, 2016*
> *Â© 2016, Joris Van den Bossche and Stijn Van Hoey
